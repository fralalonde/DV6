#! /bin/sh

# This script allows to print RTT output at the console while debugging with CLion + OpenOCD/GDB
#
# First, start OpenOCD from a CLion run config.
# Then run this script at the console:
# > watch_rtt.sh
#
# This script will:
# 1) tell OpenOCD to start it's RTT server
# 2) tail the RTT server's output
#
# Original recipe from https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/gdb-and-defmt/

# check that required apps are on path
